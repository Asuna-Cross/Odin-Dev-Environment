# Summary
This is my own personal box using Ubuntu that I use when working through the Odin Project.

It does not have any of the additional software needed for Ruby installation and would need to be installed if you wish to go that route.

# Pre-installed Software
- Git
- VSCode
- VSCode Theme - Tokyo-Night

# Commands (For reference)
Setting keyboard to gb
``sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration``
